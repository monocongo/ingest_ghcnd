# ingest_ghcnd
Python code to ingest GHCN-D (Global Historical Climate Network, Daily) files from ASCII to other formats.

Initial use case is to convert GHCN-D to the format required for input to the [WMO National Climate Monitoring Product](https://github.com/ET-NCMP/NCMP) tool. 

Included are example input files for a single station, and an example output file that should result from ingesting these inputs.
